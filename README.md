THis repository contains the articles my Model Driven Software Engineering for Data Warehousing blog.
The articles are written as Jupyter notebooks, as this enables executable code examples to liven up the text of the articles.

## Running Code Examples

1. Make sure Python 3.10 is installed on your local machine.
   Python can be downloaded here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
1. Install Pipenv on your system by running `pip install pipenv` from the command line.
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
1. Run `pipenv install` from the command line to install the required packages for your project.
1. Start run the code for article using the command `pipenv run python 'src/article_01.py'` (or any other article for that matter).

1. **Model Driven Software Engineering for Data Warehousing — Part 1: Code Generation** (article-01)

   This article is the first part of a series of articles in which I want to give an overview of how I think Model Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) can be used for data warehousing. 
   This article is about the concepts of model driven software engineering and why you should use it while developing your Data Warehouse (DWH).
   Last but not least the topics described in this article are explained using an example.
   The code for this article is found in _src/article-01.py_.
